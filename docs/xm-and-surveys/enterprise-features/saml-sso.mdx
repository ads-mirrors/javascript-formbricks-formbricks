<Note>This feature is only available with the Formbricks Enterprise plan having a SAML SSO add-on.</Note>

## Overview

Formbricks supports Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) SSO. We prioritize your ease of access and security by providing robust Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities.

### Setting up SAML login

<Steps>
  <Step title='Create a SAML application with your Identity Provider (IdP)'>
    Follow the instructions here - [SAML Setup](/development/guides/auth-and-provision/setup-saml-with-identity-providers)
  </Step>
  <Step title='Configure access to the IdP SAML app'>
    Ensure that all users who need access to Formbricks have access to the IdP SAML
    app.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Retrieve XML metadata from your IdP'>
    Keep the XML metadata from your IdP accessible, as you will need it later.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Set the SAML_DATABASE_URL environment variable'>
    Set the `SAML_DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your `.env` file to a dedicated database for SAML(e.g., `postgresql://postgres:@localhost:5432/formbricks-saml`). If you're using a self-signed certificate for Postgres, include the `sslmode=no-verify` parameter.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Set the SAML_RAW_METADATA environment variable'>
    Set the `SAML_RAW_METADATA` environment variable in your `.env` file to the XML metadata from your IdP(e.g., `SAML_RAW_METADATA='<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><...>'`, please paste the metadata in single quotes)
  </Step>
  <Step title='Your users can now log into Formbricks using SAML'>
    Once setup is complete, provisioned users can log into Formbricks using SAML.
  </Step>
</Steps>
