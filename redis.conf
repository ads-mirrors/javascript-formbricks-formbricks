# Redis Memory Limit and Eviction Policy Configuration
#
# These settings allow you to control the amount of memory Redis uses and how it
# handles keys when the memory limit is reached. Uncomment the options below if
# you want to enforce a memory limit and use an eviction policy.
#
# maxmemory 1gb
#   This sets a hard limit of 1GB on Redis's memory usage. When the memory limit is
#   reached, Redis will begin evicting keys according to the eviction policy.
#
# maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
#   This sets the eviction policy to "allkeys-lru", meaning that Redis will evict
#   the least recently used key among all keys when the memory limit is reached.
